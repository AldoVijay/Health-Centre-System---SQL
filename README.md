Executive Summary

Introduction: 

The healthcare industry has become even more vital in today’s world, especially in the years following the COVID pandemic.
From birth to the end of life, every individual relies on healthcare services at various stages. With continuous advancements in medical technologies, equipment, and patient care standards, the need for an efficient and reliable data management system has grown significantly. 

A well-structured database management system plays a critical role in maintaining essential records such as patient details, physician information, department structures, medical procedures, and nursing support.
These data elements must be interconnected and easily retrievable to support timely decision-making and ensure smooth healthcare operations. 

To address these requirements and streamline the complexity of healthcare system, I developed a relational database system designed specifically for a healthcare environment.
This system ensures proper data organization, relationship mapping, and efficient retrieval of information whenever needed. 

 

Database Components: 

The database consists of the following core entities: 

Physician – Stores details such as physician ID, name, qualifications, department ID, and date of joining. 

Patient – Includes patient ID, first name, surname, address, gender, phone number, and assigned checkup physician ID. 

Nurse – Contains nurse ID, name, position, and date of joining. 

Department – Maintains department ID and department name. 

Medical Analysis Report – Stores identification details, prescriptions, patient ID, and physician ID. 

Medical Procedure – Includes physician ID, patient ID, procedure name, and the associated cost. 

Each table is interconnected using primary and foreign keys to accurately represent real-world relationships within a healthcare system. 

 


Conclusion:

SQL enables the efficient creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion (CRUD) of records across all components of the database.
By executing structured queries, healthcare data can be accessed, analysed, and managed seamlessly, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability. 
This relational database system ultimately supports smoother healthcare workflows and enhances overall data management within the organization.
